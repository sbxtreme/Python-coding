Cryptograpy is the process of converting plain text ( readable text ) into ciphertext ( unreadable text )
as well as reverse.

In order to encrypt and decrypt the files one of the best encryption standard is AES. It stands for Advanced Encryption Standard.

1)It is symmetric cipher means the sender and reciever use the same key to encrypt or decrypt the text.

2)Consists of 16 byte block size meaning each part of encrypted data is stored as 16 byte block each.

3) AES can handle 3 key length:
>> 128 bits long
>> 192 bits long
>> 256 bits long

4) While generating randomize ciphertext we use IV which is initialization vector producing distinct ciphertext.

5) For cipher text to be generated from plain text a key is required. To produce the same key for sender and reciever , we HASH the password which produces 16 byte output which is basically the key for encryption and decyption.
